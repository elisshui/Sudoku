<h1>Sudoku</h1>
One of the earliest records of Sudoku comes from 1783 when Leonhard Euler came up with what he called "Latin Squares" - a new form of magic squares. The modern 9-by-9 grid was popularized by Maki Kaji, the owner of Nikoli magazines. I had orginally coded this game in C. I utilized the backtracking algorithm to randomly generate a grid each time the game was run. However, I sought to create a more interactive game. Thus, I used Python and the pygame library to re-write the code and create a graphical user interface.<br><br>

<strong>Project Goals:</strong>
* To become proficient in splitting up code into different functions and files.<br>
* To dig deeper into Python's functions.<br><br>
